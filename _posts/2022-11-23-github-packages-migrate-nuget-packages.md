## Overview

_This is follow-up to my previous post, [Quickly Migrate NuGet Packages to a New Feed in Bulk](/posts/nuget-pusher-script/), where I migrate NuGet packages to a new Azure Artifacts feed_

I recently had a customer ask me how they could migrate their NuGet packages from one GitHub instance to another (e.g.: from GitHub Enterprise Server to GitHub Enterprise Cloud). I wasn't aware of any tooling that did this, so I decided to write my own.

## The script

I decided to store the script in a separate GitHub repo than my [github-misc-scripts](/posts/github-misc-scripts/) repo to better facilitate any feedback/suggestions/improvements I might get.

The repo: [https://github.com/joshjohanning/github-packages-migrate-nuget-packages](https://github.com/joshjohanning/github-packages-migrate-nuget-packages)

## Running the script

You can call the script via:

```bash
./migrate-nuget-packages-between-orgs.sh \
  <source-org> 
  <source-host> \
  <target-org> \
  <target-pat> \
  <path-to-gpr>
```

An example of this in practice:

```bash
./migrate-nuget-packages-between-orgs.sh \
  joshjohanning-org-packages \
  github.com \
  joshjohanning-org-packages-migrated \
  ghp_xyz \
  /home/codespace/.dotnet/tools/gpr
```

## Notes

It uses [gpr](https://github.com/jcansdale/gpr) to re-push the packages to the target org. It assumes that the target org's repo has the same name as the source.

I initially tried writing this with [`dotnet nuget push`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-nuget-push), but that doesn't seem to work since the package's `<RepositoryUrl>` element would still be referencing the original repository. See:

```
Pushing NUnit3.DotNetNew.Template_1.7.1.nupkg to 'https://nuget.pkg.github.com/joshjohanning-org-packages-migrated'...
  PUT https://nuget.pkg.github.com/joshjohanning-org-packages-migrated/
warn : Source owner 'joshjohanning-org-packages-migrated' does not match repo owner 'joshjohanning-org-packages' in repository element.
  BadRequest https://nuget.pkg.github.com/joshjohanning-org-packages-migrated/ 180ms
error: Response status code does not indicate success: 400 (Bad Request).
```
